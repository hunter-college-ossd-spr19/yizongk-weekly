This repository belongs to Yi Zong Kuang, senior at Hunter College CUNY. And contains weekly blogs written about my progress (and possibly some codes!) in my pursue of learning the Way of the Open Source. May the Source be with you (terrible, terrible puns. I know...).

# About My Jekyll-based Blog Hosted on GitHub Pages

Jekyll is a simple, open-source, blog-aware, static site generator.
Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your 
Jekyll blog on GitHubâ€™s servers for free. The difficult work has
already been done for you; all you have to do is some simple
user-specific tinkering in the repository that has been created for
you.
