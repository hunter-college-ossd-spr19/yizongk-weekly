#Editing Open Street Map

[My Edit History](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/yizongk_hunter/history)

We begin the semester by contributing data to Open Street Map, an open source data repository on maps, location, and its relevent data. I made 5 contribution to the map. I updated the area around my neighborhood, which I am familiar with. I updated my parent's house's address, as well as our privately own garage. While editing the garage, I realize my neighborhood lacks ALOT of missing data on privately own garage, so I decided to make my next 3 edits on private garage around my neighborhood.
