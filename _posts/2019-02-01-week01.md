## Editing Open Street 
### January 29th, 2019

[My Edit History](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/yizongk_hunter/history)

We begin the semester by contributing data to Open Street Map, an open source data repository on maps, location, and its relevent data. I made 5 contribution to the map. I updated the area around my neighborhood, which I am familiar with. I updated my parent's house's address, as well as our privately own garage. While editing the garage, I realize my neighborhood lacks ALOT of missing data on privately own garage, so I decided to make my next 3 edits on private garage around my neighborhood.

# "Open Source" versus "Free Software"

In a concise way to describe both term is that, Free Software outlines the idealogy concerning how software defined as "free", while Open Source defines a practical way to implement methods of coding to keep our Free Software idealogy in place. 

A good way to think of Free Software is to think of it as "Free speech and not free beer". Free speech as in, everyone can see, change the source code. And not free beer as in that it doesn't have to be free of price.
