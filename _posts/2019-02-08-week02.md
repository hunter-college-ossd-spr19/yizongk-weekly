## Thinking about my open source project
### Febuary 6th, 2019

I have done contribution to previous open source project, and have gotten its PR merged into the official repo. But for this semester, I think I will continue doing similar tasks for my assigned open source project: Fixing game mechanic bugs in Cataclysm DDA. 

Since I have already decided to conitinue working on Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead (At this point, I even remember how to spell the exact name of the game.), I think I don't need to think about a ideal project to support. I have enjoyed the dev community that exists in this repo, they are very helpful.
