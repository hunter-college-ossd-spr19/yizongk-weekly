## Doing the git excercise in class
### Febuary 13th, 2019

This week, not much has happened except what we did in class. During our meeting, we formed groups and did a simulation of some git work flow. Each of the group member are assigned to do a certain task that will eventually interfere with other team members. Through this simulation, we were able to learn/practice how to resolve such conflicts, such as a merge conflict, or a need to update local repository to the lastest version.
