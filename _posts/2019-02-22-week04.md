#### Reflection on project evaluation

 I found this activity to be very time consuming. The amount of time I need to dig for very specific details and counting them took about 30 min just for one project that was on github, DOxygen in my case. There were very simple tasks that just needed to be done manualy many many times, such as counting up the commits for the past 12 weeks or so, and it would spark ideas in my head that maybe I can write some sort of script that will do this for me. But that idea quickly evaporate since it would take even more time to write such script. 

 This activity was useful though, I learned that most common OSS was not as active in PR, Issues,and commits as I thought at first. What was happening most of the time was discusstions on those three topics. I am just suprise that people can pump out really good software with so little actual commits, and PRs. But that makes sense, because what is being pushed to the repo is quality codes.
