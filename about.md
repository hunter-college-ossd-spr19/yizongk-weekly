### More Information

My name is Yi Zong Kuang, I am a senior at Hunter College CUNY. And this repostiory is for a class about Open Source, under the guidance of Professor Stewart Weiss of Hunter College. It is where I will post my status and possibly codes for any Open Source Project I will be contributing to. I will be contributing to Cataclysm-DDA, which is a open-sourced post-apocalypse survival game.
